     My name is Alejandra Lara. I am a current senior at Syracuse University studying IMT with a concentration in Information Security and I am interested in entering the field of Cybersecurity as an analyst or pen tester. Some of my skills include:
        o	Proficiency in Python, HTML/CSS, Haskell, ReactJS, NextJS, Firebase, and Vercel
        o	Understanding of DNS, Google Analytics, APIs, and SEO
As for accomplishments, whether big or small, I take pride in each of them:
        o	Attending Syracuse University as a HEOP scholar
        o	Entering a Software Engineering Apprenticeship and developing 5 AI based apps
        o	Joining Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Senoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc.
        o	Working as a research assistant under a Physics professor for Quantum Metrology.
As a first generation Mexican-Puerto Rican student, my entire life has revolved around academics and always pursuing being my best self. This has helped to foster a love for learning outside of academia no matter where I go or what I am doing. Whether it is learning a new recipe, researching obscure animals, or learning new gaming strategies, I am always willing to put time and effort into learning and developing new skills. Being such a firm believer in literacy in all aspects, I always ensure to dedicate my free time outside of work and academia to volunteering at elementary schools to help students with grammar and reading.
