        <p>
            As a first generation Mexican-Puerto Rican student, my entire life has revolved around academics and always pursuing being my best self. 
            This has helped to foster a love for learning outside of academia no matter where I go or what I am doing. Whether it is learning a new recipe, researching obscure animals, or learning new gaming strategies, I am always willing to put time and effort into learning and developing new skills. 
            Being such a firm believer in literacy in all aspects, I always ensure to dedicate my free time outside of work and academia to volunteering at elementary schools to help students with grammar and reading.
