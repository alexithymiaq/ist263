                <h3>Where to Start</h3>
                <p>
                    You can start by buying themed decks or preconstructed
                    sets to get a feel for the game. I reccomend starting with affordable,
                    modern sets to avoid scams and fake cards. <br><br>

                    Some of these sets include:

                <h2>Building a Beginner Deck</h2>
                <h3>Basics of Deck Building</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 60 cards in total in a deck. They are divded up as 20
                    Pokemon, 20 trainers, and 20 energies. Although this can vary as you play
                    and build your own strategies! You should choose a type (Fire, Grass, Fairy,
                    Psychic, and more!) and build around it!
                </p>
                <h3>Common Beginner Deck Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Theme Decks: Pre-made balanced decks. These are good
                    for starting out and getting a feel for the game!
                    <br><br>
                    Competitive Starter Decks: Also pre-made but modified to focus
                    on certain strategies. these are reccomended once you get a feel for the game
                    but also want to focus on specifics (defense, offense, etc.)                   
                </p>
                <h3>Popular Sets for Deck Building (U.S & Japan)</h3>

                <h2>How To Play The Game (Basics)</h2>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>
                    Knock out your opponent’s Pokémon and 
                    collect all prize cards (or whatever else is at stake)
                </p>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    Each player has a deck of 60. You'll then draw 7 cards,
                    place 1 active Pokemon, and set up 5 on your bench.
                </p>
                <h3>Turn Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    Each player will draw a card, play a basic Pokemon, evolve Pokemon,
                    or attach energy. You can play trainer cards for effects and attack
                    if you have the required energy.
                </p>
                <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal is to collect all prize cards, ensure your opponent cannot draw
                    a card at the start of their turn, or if your opponent has no Pokemon left!

                <h2>Trading Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trade based on card values and not just looks (While this is also okay,
                        but for less competitive players)
                    </li>
                     <li>Learn how to spot fake cards (blurry prints, wrong fonts, fake
                         holofoil, etc)
                    </li>
                    <li>Build trust with trading partners, especially when trading online</li>
