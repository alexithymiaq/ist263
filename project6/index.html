                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Alejandra. I am a current Senior at 
                    Syracuse University, and I have been collecting Pokémon
                    cards since I was 8 years old.
                </p>
                <h3>My History</h3>
                <p>
                    I first got into Pokémon when I was around 6 or 7 years old.
                    My older cousins were huge fans and my journey started with 
                    waking up on Saturday mornings to sit in the living room and watch new episodes.
                    A world filled with mythical creatures that could be your companion just fascinated me and soon my 
                    older cousins introduced me into TCG. From there I would beg my mother or my father at the store for a 
                    new pack or to go to stores and see what I could find. I was obsessed to say the least. My father bought 
                    me binder after binder as my collection grew. I kept duplicates until there were pages dedicated to one 
                    Pokémon. Eventually in middle school I created my first ever actual set, starring my favorite Pokémon at 
                    the time, Jigglypuff. Of course I lost many battles, but nevertheless I continued to pursue victory 
                    amongst the boys in my class. I would rush to finish my lunch so I could pull out my cards and challenge 
                    the boys outside on the pavement. Over time I learned and made better sets, I showed off cards I had 
                    that other students did not. I am 20 now, and since then my love for Pokémon has not died. After 
                    moving around as a child, I unfortunately lost my binders, but I remain in the world of Pokémon 
                    through games and rewatching the tv shows. This website is made with love and dedication. 
                    For me, Pokémon was never just a card game or a tv show, it was love shared between my cousins and I 
                    showing off which cards we pulled, between my father and I sitting in the living room with a bowl of 
                    cereal watching the show. This website is a page dedicated to that love and to highlight the amazing 
                    history and stories of Pokémon TCG.
