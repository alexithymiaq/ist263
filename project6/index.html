      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Alejandra. I am a current Senior at Syracuse University, and I have been collecting Pokémon cards since I was 8 years old.</p>
      <h3>My History</h3>
      <p>I first got into Pokémon when I was around 6 or 7 years old. My older cousins were huge fans and my journey started with watching Saturday morning episodes of the Pokémon anime. A world filled with mythical creatures that could be your companions fascinated me, and soon my cousins introduced me to the Pokémon TCG.</p>
      <p>I would beg my parents for booster packs and carefully fill binders with my growing collection. My first themed set starred my favorite Pokémon at the time—Jigglypuff! Though I lost many playground battles, I learned and improved, and Pokémon became a way to connect with friends and family. This website celebrates that love and history.</p>
