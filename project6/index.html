        <h3>Origins (1996–1999)</h3>
        <p>
          The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) was first introduced in Japan by Media Factory in 1996 and made its U.S. debut in 1999, published by Wizards of the Coast. The earliest set, known as the <em>Base Set</em>, featured iconic cards like Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur that quickly became collector favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          These early cards established the foundation for competitive play, collectible rarity, and the unique synergy between Pokémon’s game and anime worlds.

      <h3>Growth & Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Between 1999 and 2002, the Pokémon TCG exploded in popularity, leading to worldwide tournaments and the launch of numerous expansions like <em>Jungle</em>, <em>Fossil</em>, and <em>Team Rocket</em>. Each new set introduced creative mechanics, energy types, and evolving artwork styles.
      </p>

        Today, Pokémon TCG continues to grow with digital play on Pokémon TCG Live and large-scale events such as regional and international championships.

        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Alejandra, a Senior at Syracuse University. I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards since I was 8 years old, and this website is a tribute to that passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pokémon for me is more than a hobby — it’s a bridge to family, nostalgia, and creativity. Through this page, I hope to inspire others to rediscover the magic of collecting.
