        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Alejandra, a Senior at Syracuse University. 
            I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards since I was 8 years old. 
            This website is made with love and dedication. 
            For me, Pokémon was never just a card game or a tv show, it was love shared between my cousins and I 
            showing off which cards we pulled, between my father and I sitting in the living room with a bowl of 
            cereal watching the show. This website is a page dedicated to that love and to highlight the amazing 
            history and stories of Pokémon TCG.
