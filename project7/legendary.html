                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                   Pokémon cards are considered rare for many different reasons, and their value often comes from a combination of factors rather than just one. 
                   Some cards were produced in extremely limited print runs, making them hard to find from the very beginning. 
                   Others were released as tournament exclusives, given only to top-ranking competitors or distributed at special events, which increases their rarity.
                   Misprints and error cards also become highly sought after because they exist in such small quantities and often get corrected in later printings. 
                   In other cases, a card’s popularity comes simply from fan attachment such as iconic characters, nostalgic artwork, or legendary moments in the franchise 
                   can all elevate a card’s desirability.
                   
                   In this section, I have included several of the most famous Pokémon cards ever created. Each card entry will highlight its background story,
                   what contributes to its rarity, how it fits into Pokémon card history, and notable sales records that show just how valuable and iconic these
                   pieces of the Pokémon Trading Card Game have become.

                    You might be wondering why these cards are such a big deal, and honestly, 
                    there isn’t just one reason; each card has its own story. Some of the most iconic cards are super rare because 
                    they were printed in small numbers or only given out at special events. Others, like the Base Set Charizard, Blastoise, 
                    and Venusaur, are important because they were part of the very first wave of Pokémon cards that kicked off the whole collecting craze 
                    back in the ’90s. They represent the early days of the TCG, which makes them feel even more legendary.

                    <br><br>
                    But rarity isn’t the only thing that makes a card special. 
                    A lot of the value comes from the emotional connection people have to certain Pokémon. 
                    Maybe it was your favorite character growing up, the card you always wanted but never pulled, or one you traded for on the playground. 
                    That nostalgia hits hard. Because of that, cards aren’t just collectibles, they’re pieces of childhood, reminders of big moments, 
                    and a way for fans to connect with each other. That mix of history, scarcity, and personal meaning is what keeps these cards so loved 
                    in the Pokémon community.
