        <h3>Origins (1996–1999)</h3>
        <p>
          The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) was first introduced in Japan by Media Factory in 1996 
          and made its U.S. debut in 1999 under Wizards of the Coast. The earliest release, known as the 
          Base Set, featured legendary cards like Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur. These cards quickly 
          became must-haves for both children and collectors as the Pokémon craze spread worldwide. These 
          early sets laid the groundwork for everything the TCG would become, shaping competitive play, 
          defining collectible rarity, and creating a unique synergy between the trading card game, the video games, 
          and the anime. Even today, many of these original cards remain highly recognizable and continue to drive collector interest,
          highlighting their lasting impact on the hobby.

      <h3>Growth & Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Between 1999 and 2002, the Pokémon TCG experienced an explosive surge in popularity, sparking worldwide tournaments and 
        the launch of numerous expansions such as Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. Each new set introduced innovative mechanics, 
        new Pokémon and energy types, and evolving artwork styles, keeping players and collectors engaged while expanding the TCG universe. 
        This period cemented Pokémon as a major cultural phenomenon and set the stage for decades of continued growth. Today, the TCG continues
        to thrive with digital play on Pokémon TCG Live, official organized play programs, and large-scale events including regional and international 
        championships that attract thousands of players and spectators each year.

            <h3>Competitive Play</h3>
            <p>
                The Pokémon TCG isn’t just about collecting cards, it’s also a strategic game that challenges players to think 
                critically and adapt quickly. Official tournaments began in the early 2000s and have since evolved into prestigious 
                Pokémon World Championships, where players from around the globe compete for titles and recognition. These events test 
                not only a player’s deck-building and strategy skills but also their ability to read opponents and make split-second decisions. 
                Competitive play has become a central aspect of the TCG, inspiring communities worldwide and ensuring that Pokémon remains both a 
                beloved collectible hobby and a dynamic, skill-based game.
