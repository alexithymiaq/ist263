                <h3>Where to Start</h3>
                <p>
                    You can start by buying themed decks or preconstructed sets, which are designed to be beginner-friendly 
                    and give you a solid introduction to how the game works. These products come with balanced cards and clear 
                    strategies, making it easier to learn the rules, practice gameplay, and understand different mechanics 
                    without feeling overwhelmed. I recommend starting with affordable, modern sets, since they are widely 
                    available, easier to verify as authentic, and less likely to involve scams or fake cards. Once you’re 
                    more comfortable, you can gradually expand your collection with booster packs or singles that fit your 
                    play style and goals.

                <h2>Building a Beginner Deck</h2>
                <h3>Basics of Deck Building</h3>
                <p>
                    A standard deck consists of 60 cards total, typically divided into 20 Pokémon, 20 Trainer cards, and 20 Energy cards. 
                    This balance helps new players learn the flow of the game and understand how each card type works together. 
                    As you gain more experience, this ratio can change depending on your strategy, play style, and the deck you are building. 
                    It’s also important to choose a specific Pokémon type—such as Fire, Grass, Fairy, Psychic, and many more. 
                    Build your deck around that type to create stronger synergy and more consistent gameplay.
                </p>
                <h3>Common Beginner Deck Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Theme Decks are pre-made, well-balanced decks designed for beginners. 
                    They are great for starting out, learning the rules, and getting comfortable with how a 
                    deck should function during a match.
                    <br><br>
                    Competitive Starter Decks are also pre-made, but they are more refined and focused on specific strategies. 
                    These decks are recommended once you understand the basics and want to improve your gameplay by emphasizing certain 
                    strengths, such as strong offense, solid defense, or efficient energy use.                
                </p>
